📌 Business Process Explanation – Missing Persons & Human Trafficking Alert System (BPMN)

This BPMN diagram describes the full process of how a missing-person or suspected human-trafficking case moves through different actors, from reporting to resolution.

The diagram uses swimlanes for each role:

Public user

Police station

National police bureau

Investigation unit

Alert & media channels

Local authorities

System database

🟦 1. Case Reporting (Public User Lane)

The process starts when a citizen identifies a missing person situation

The user submits a report through the system

The system automatically captures basic details

🟦 2. Police Station Actions

When the report reaches a police officer:

A case officer reviews the submitted information

Officer validates the data

If information is incomplete → request additional details

If information is valid → continue with registration

🟦 3. National Police Bureau Review

After validation:

The national bureau logs the report

Assigns a report number

Stores information in the national system

Classifies the incident type (missing, suspected trafficking, unknown, etc.)

🟦 4. Case Assignment to Investigation Unit

Once approved:

The case is forwarded to an investigation team

A case officer receives the file

Investigation begins

A record of investigation actions is created

🟦 5. Verification & Alert Decision

The system asks:

“Is the case confirmed?”

If Yes:

Create national alert

Notify police stations countrywide

Push information to alert channels

If No:

Case is still stored but no alert is sent

🟦 6. Alert Publishing

When the case is verified and high-risk:

Information is shared to:

Media

Social media accounts

Police bulletin

Internal channels

Local authorities also receive details

🟦 7. Local Authorities Role

Local officials:

Dispatch search teams

Patrol

Coordinate community support

Handle possible lead information

Give feedback to national police

🟦 8. System Updates & Monitoring

The system continues to monitor:

New leads

Public tips

Police updates

🟦 9. Case Closure

When the person is found or the investigation ends:

Case record is updated

System stores closure details

The case is archived

Process ends

🔵 Key Outcomes of the Workflow

✔ Clear reporting structure
✔ Increased national coordination
✔ Faster alert distribution
✔ Improved investigation tracking
✔ Central database storage
✔ National + local response collaboration
